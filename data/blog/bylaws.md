Individual Officers

Individual officers may make independent decisions in carrying out the duties of their offices.

Nominee:

Must be a DCSCO member;

Must support the Purposes and basic policies of DCSCO and recognize that DCSCO is an effective organization working for all children and youth;

Should have effectively carried out previous DCSCO and/or other organizational responsibilities;

Should have knowledge of the organization and its role in the school and community;

Should be willing to give DCSCO priority and commitment including attendance at meetings;

Must be fair and objective and concerned for the well being and best interests of DCSCO; and

Must understand the importance of effective teamwork.

No member shall hold more than one elected or appointed office.

J. Contacting Nominees

It is the nominating committee chairman’s responsibility to contact each nominee, but any committee member may be asked to make the contact and report to the chairman. It is not advisable to talk a reluctant individual into accepting a nomination.

Consent of each nominee should be obtained, while the committee is in session, in order to place the name in nomination. If consent cannot be obtained during the meeting, the chairman will inform the committee members of the results of contacts made outside of the committee meetings.

Nominees should be given a clear indication of the responsibilities of the office and how much time may be involved. If requested, a printed job description can be provided. Individuals considering accepting nomination to an elected office should be advised that responsibilities of the office may include attendance at leadership training meetings, workshops, and/or the PTO annual convention.

In the event that no qualified candidate can be found for a particular office, it is better to leave the office vacant than to fill it with a person not able to do the job. After the election, the board-elect may fill any vacant positions according to DCSCO bylaws.

K. The Election

1. Thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of the election meeting must be provided to the membership.

2. The president presides at the election meeting.

3. The privilege of voting shall be limited to members of DCSCO who are present, one vote per family, and have been verified using the current attendance list. Members of the community, who do not have a student enrolled in the school, must present a valid ID and current utility bill that shows they live within the school boundaries.

4. Election of officers is held at the annual meeting and will come under “new business” on the agenda. The president may call upon the parliamentarian to read the sections of the bylaws pertaining to nominations and elections.

5. After the parliamentarian has finished, the president calls upon the chairman of the nominating committee to read the report of the committee. If a nominee has withdrawn prior to the election and another nominee has been selected, the chairman will read a revised report to inform the membership of the new nominee.

6. The president restates the slate of nominees and asks each one to stand. The president conducts the election of officers even if (he/she is) nominated for an office. The president thanks the nominating committee for its report and states:

“According to our bylaws, nominations from the floor are now in order.”

The privilege of nominating from the floor is extended to members of the association who meet Article X, Section K, item 3. A qualified member may nominate his or her self.

Nominations do not require a second, only the nominee’s consent.

The president can:

a. Ask for additional nominations for all positions in the order in which they are listed in the Bylaws, Article V, Section A, before closing nominations for all elected offices and then proceed with the election; or

b. Ask for additional nominations for each position, one at a time, in the order in which they are listed in the Bylaws, Article V, Section A, and then proceed to elect the officer after nominations are closed on each position.

Officers are elected by a majority vote of those present and eligible to vote, providing the quorum as stated in the bylaws has been met.

L. Voice Vote

If there is but one nominee for any office, the ballot vote for that office may be dispensed with, and the election held by voice vote, as described above.

A member who wishes to vote by ballot for any office may move that the vote be taken by ballot. The motion to vote by ballot must be recognized and voted upon immediately without debate. A majority vote is required for adoption.

M. Two or More Nominees for Office

When there are two or more nominees for an office, the election shall be held by ballot, as stated in the bylaws.

The communications director should have ballot slips available. Even if the nominating committee presents only one name for each office, there is the possibility that nominations will be presented from the floor.

N. Ballot Vote

1. When there are two or more nominees for an office, the election is held by ballot. To verify eligibility to vote, the membership list must be checked before ballots are distributed. The secretary has the official membership list. If a membership list is not available, all present will be allowed to vote. If it is known prior to the election meeting that there will be two or more nominees for any office, ballots may be distributed at a registration table as members arrive for the meeting and present their membership cards.

2. The president appoints a tellers committee, including a chairman and at least two (2) tellers, whose duties are to distribute, collect, and count the ballots. Ballots may also be collected in a ballot box.

3. The president requests all members eligible to vote to rise and be counted. This count will determine the number of ballots to be tallied.

4. A nominee for an office cannot be involved in the election procedure as a teller who collects ballots and counts votes.

5. Blank ballots are not counted.

6. Illegal ballots are counted to determine the number of votes cast, but are not applied as a vote for or against any nominee. Ballots are considered illegal if:

They are unintelligible;

They contain the name of a nominee who is not a member; or

Two or more filled out ballots are folded together. These are recorded as one illegal vote.

7. In a contested election, each nominee may designate a person as an observer at the time the ballots are counted.

8. If another vote is necessary, the voting members must be recounted to establish the number of ballots to be tallied. If a member eligible to vote was not present when the original ballot was cast but arrives in time for another vote, the member is entitled to vote.

9. The results of the voting are reported by the chairman of the tellers, in writing to the president, as follows:

Number of members eligible to vote ****\_\_****

Number of votes cast ****\_\_****

Number needed to elect ****\_\_****

(Nominee)****\_\_**** Received ****\_\_****

(Nominee)****\_\_**** Received ****\_\_****

10. This procedure is repeated for each contested office. The president announces who has been elected to office. Unless requested, the president does not have to announce the number of votes cast for each nominee, but the complete Tellers’ Report must be recorded in the minutes. Following the announcement of the vote, the chairman of the tellers moves that the ballots be destroyed.

11. It is permissible to use these two procedures in one election by using voice vote for uncontested offices and a ballot for those that have two or more nominees.

12. A challenge to the election procedure or outcome must be made during the election meeting. For additional information, see Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised – Point of Order section.

O. Voting Rights of Officers

All DCSCO officers, including the parliamentarian, have the same voting privileges as other members. The president’s impartiality is protected by voting only when the

vote is by ballot.

P. Previous Nominating Committee Members

Make a list of nominating committee members and the year(s) in which they served. This will serve as a written reference for DCSCO. The names of the nominating committee members must be placed in the minutes as the official record.

Voting

Only members as defined in Article IV are entitled to vote.

For actions requiring a vote by the entire membership, each immediate family is entitled to one vote at a meeting (an “Eligible Vote”), regardless of the number of family members present. (For example, if two parents and their two children attend a DCSCO meeting together, they may collectively cast one vote.)

Decisions at membership meetings shall be made by majority vote.

Quorum

Except for an amendment to the Bylaws, a quorum is attained by any number of attendees, as long as the meeting was publicly announced in accordance with the guidelines above.

For an amendment to the Bylaws, a quorum can only be established if the number of Eligible Votes (as defined in this Article) present at the membership meeting represent at least 15% of the total number of Eligible Votes in the membership.
