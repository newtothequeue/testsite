# 2022-2023 Donation Annual Campaign

**The Don Callejon School 2022-2023 Donation Annual Campaign has now ended**
**Parent Honor Roll**: Donations of $400+ per student (excluding corporate match) can be viewed at: https://tinyurl.com/dcsco2022

Campaign Date: Sept 15 - Oct 14, 2022.  

Click this link for information on how you can contribute: www.omella.com/dcsco

Please join us to support your child's grade level & school wide programs. Over the years, many programs have been cut from the district budget. We depend on parent donations to continue programs such as:

- Art
- Music
- STEM lab
- Enrichment assemblies
- Field trips
- Recess sports programs
- Clubs
- Author visits
- Academic subscriptions
- **and much more!**

Check out our highlight reel: https://tinyurl.com/dcscohighlights

This annual campaign is **our only fundraiser**. We will not ask you to sell items to raise money, or to make multiple donations for specific programs/events.  The suggested contribution is \$400 per student for the full year (less than \$40/month!) but **ANY amount** will be greatly appreciated. The first \$80 of every donation will apply to your child's grade level fund. 

If we meet our total fundraising goal of $90,000, we will celebrate with a school-wide Kona Shaved Ice Truck Party on Thursday Oct 20, 2022.

Most companies will match your donation. For example, if you donate \$200 then your company will donate another \$200. Check with your employer to see if they offer this important program. DCSCO is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non profit (EIN 77-0654513).

If you have questions, please email board@dcsco.org. Thank you for your support!
